## Character 1

I’m a scholar currently studying life science and biology. I’m done with all the trash essays that incompetent authors write to create useless terminology and progress science to no extent. But things have changed when I met Academics Spider. I became registered member of Academics Spider’s internal test last year. The past four months has been amazing. Wake up in the morning and turn up my phone, I see several elite papers in my mailbox, waiting to enhance my academic competence. Without having to go through so many trashes to get the real one, I have more ideas in the last month than that of a year before I use Academics Spider.

## Character 2

I’m a scholar in material chemistry. I didn’t know Academics Spider until my friend informed me. Then I was surprised that so many peers were already enjoying the freedom of researching with Academics Spider ahead of me. I can’t stand with this. So I immediately became registered. Ever since I began to use Academics Spider, the professor has seen me in a different way.
