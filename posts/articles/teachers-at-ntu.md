Yes, I have finally made my decision to blog in English. Call me a peacock or whatever you like. Nice ones would be appreciated and recorded for future use, in certain occasion, where you need such comments most.

Right now my witful roommate is giving his first try on Turkey noodles with full pack of spicy sauce. It seems the red nematode enjoyed the guy's first night, making him screeching "Yeez" "Fucking good, better than the couple fucking next door the whole night". He dishware fell off on the ground, feeling ashamed for their master's lewd vindication.

It's little bit off the topic though.

I have enjoyed Singapore so far. You buy cheaper grocery with a lot higher price here. You apply for your bank card at a speed rate of literal minus nots. You take buses broadcasting stops on the outter surface of the tincan, just in order to impede passengers inside from alighting at proper station. You eat rice made up of environmentalist recyclable plastic. If you want to go diet, come here, it is either you or your purse that gets a slim build.

Meanwhile, you get to know people of various ethnics, you feel this especially make acquaintance with a Nigerian-Indian Chinese, proficient in Tamil. You peruse the giant greenplant down the road, which reminds you that you are in a tropical strip. Board on Singapore flyer and take a glance at the port, the ships dotted on the sea. If fortunately timed, you may encounter a mirage on the sea surface, which is a reflection of light on the glass window, feel the thrilling vibe of a bakadekai cruise howling towards you.

I mean, it is the pros and cons that make up a country. I admire the beauty of the conutry, but also reserve my opinions on some discomfort it has given me.

The preparatory program so far is a boredom that rewinds me to senior high. Exclude chemistry from that list. Is is fucking torture to memorise all those latin organic prefixes and suffixes at the beginning. But after a few days of jumping between dictionaries and textbooks like an ape you get used to it. Besides chemistry so far contains the most amount of unfamiliar university spectrum of knowledge. Like stereomers and its detailed classification, which senior high have not covered. Although it will not be bad to sleep with your ex, new dates always turn out to be more exciting.

I have joint a local group of table tennis. Guys there are bloody nice. The captain is rarely responsible and the group members are passionate and willing to follow up. That is the situation I seldom experience back in China, where, anecdotally speaking, people always lack some team spirit.

Anyway, Singapore is a wonderful country for colledge, and I do not want to waste any fucking second doing fucking pointless stuff that leaves no trace in my future. Let us make something here me brothers!
