I've always believed that blogging should be free and flexible.

Ideas are precious and evaneous, they come and go at their will. Between the spark of inspiration and the act of
  writing it down, there should be no barriers. However, the reality is somehow frustrating.

Third-party blogging platforms like *Zhihu*, *Xiaohongshu* often limit freedom of expression under
  layers of
  scrutiny. Self-hosted systems like *Typecho*, *Wordpress* require a server, which can get expensive. And
  what
  about static site generators hosted on GitHub, like *Hexo* or *Hugo*? Well, not everyone can or wants to
  wrangle
  with JavaScript, HTML and CSS before they can post a thought.

There seems no perfect solution, or is there?

Let's take a step further about static blogging. GitHub Discussions is an open forum built into every repository
  (when enabled), and it has everything a minimalist blog needs: Markdown support, threaded comments, and category
  organization. What more do we really need?

That's why I build **Glog** — a lightweight app to turn GitHub Discussions into a smooth,
  frictionless blogging
  experience. Give it a shot and hope you will like it!

Made with ❤️ and Cursor.
