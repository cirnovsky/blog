# Hasty Generalisation

A.k.a. the over-generalisation fallacy. An informal fallacy wherein a conclusion is drawn about all or many instances of a phenomenon on the basis of one of a few instances of that phenomenon.

E.g. Stereotype.

# ad hominem

Latin for 'to the person', short for *__argumentum ad hominem__*. In accordance with Whately, *ad hominem* arguments are "addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual".

Some voices, however, argue that *ad hominem* arguments are not necessarily fallacy, that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue, as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words, according to Walton (Who the hell is this dude).

E.g. Fuck you wronglie ass.

# Bandwagon Appeal

In Latin *__argumentum ad populum__*, meaning 'appeal to the people'. A fallacious argument which is based on claiming a truth or affirming something is good or correct because many people think so.

Some voices, however, argue that *argumentum ad populum* arguments are not necessarily fallacy, such as in political dialogue within a democracy, according to Walton (Yes the same dude. He must be good at critical thinking).

# Red Herring

A **red herring** is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important question.

E.g. tI  think we should make the academic requirements stricter for students. I recommend you support this because we are in a budget crisis, and we do not want our salaries affected.

# Straw Man

A straw man fallacy (sometimes written as strawman) is the informal fallacy of refuting an argument different from the one actually under discussion, while not recognizing or acknowledging the distinction.[1] One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man".

# Slippery Slope

# Post hoc ergo propter hoc

# Begging the Question

# False Dichotomy

# Association fallacy
