In 2022, the launch of ChatGPT astonished everyone. It was the first time that AI displayed its powerfulness in such a explicit way to humans. People found it interesting to play with such a super intelligent yet obedient "servant".

However, things quickly went beyond fun.

In 2023, Turnitin, a well-known education platform, revealed that over 3.3% paper were more than 80% AI-generated. That is 2.1 million papers in number [^1].  In 2024, Turnitin reported 3% papers of <strong>fully</strong> AI-written content[^2]. And so far in 2025, Wall Street Journal reported ~40% of middle/high school students used AI without permission and nearlf half of college students did so [^3].

Despite the statistics, some are proposing integration of AI into education system, claiming that it can enhance students' learning experience and engagement.
