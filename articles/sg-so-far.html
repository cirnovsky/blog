<p>Yes, I have finally made my decision to blog in English. Call me a
peacock or whatever you like. Nice ones would be appreciated and
recorded for future use, on certain occasions, when you need such
comments most.</p>
<p>Right now, my witty roommate is giving his first try on Turkey
noodles with a full pack of spicy sauce. It seems the red nematode
enjoyed the guy's first night, making him screech "Yeez! Fucking good,
better than the couple next door fucking whole night". His dishware fell
off on the ground, feeling ashamed of their master's lewd
vindication.</p>
<p>It's a little bit off the topic though.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed Singapore so far. You buy cheaper groceries at a lot
higher prices here. You apply for your bank card at a speed rate of
literal minus nots. You take buses broadcasting stops on the outer
surface of the tin can, just to impede passengers inside from alighting
at the proper station. You eat rice made up of environmentalist
recyclable plastic. If you want to go diet, come here, it is either you
or your purse that gets a slim build.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you get to know people of various ethnicities, you feel
this especially make acquaintance with a Nigerian-Indian Chinese,
proficient in Tamil. You peruse the giant green plant down the road,
which reminds you that you are in a tropical strip. Board on the
Singapore flyer and take a glance at the port, the ships dotted on the
sea. If fortunately timed, you may encounter a mirage on the sea
surface, which is a reflection of light on the glass window, and feel
the thrilling vibe of a bakadekai cruise howling towards you.</p>
<p>I mean, it is the pros and cons that make up a country. I admire the
country's beauty, but I also reserve my opinions on some discomfort it
has given me.</p>
<p>The preparatory program so far is a boredom that rewinds me to senior
high. Exclude chemistry from that list. It is fucking torture to
memorize all those Latin organic prefixes and suffixes at the beginning.
But after a few days of jumping between dictionaries and textbooks like
an ape you get used to it. Besides chemistry so far contains the most
unfamiliar university-level knowledge, like stereoisomer and its
detailed classification, which senior high have not covered. Although it
will not be bad to sleep with your ex, new dates always turn out to be
more exciting.</p>
<p>I have joined a local table tennis group. The guys there are bloody
nice. The captain is responsible and the group members are passionate
and willing to follow up. I seldom experience that situation back in
China, where, anecdotally speaking, people always lack some team
spirit.</p>
<p>Anyway, Singapore is a wonderful country for college, and I do not
want to waste any fucking second doing fucking pointless stuff that
leaves no trace in my future. Let us make something here me
brothers!</p>
