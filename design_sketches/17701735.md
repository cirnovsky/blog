- Starting out, Forsaken is not typical Karry5307, for Forsaken is a Windows coder

- (I try to export Forsaken's bash_history, but with no content, and thers's no use prints on Forsaken's Ubuntu system)

- But how do he cheat?

- Here's how

- Assuming the exam time range is [8:00, 12:20]

- Thus the total time is around 4hrs

- Approximately 3hrs of which is consumed on Bilibili (usually above this line)

- The rest 1hr is used on searching editorials

- When the description is hugely modified

- (He is so smart) he views past information

- What does it mean? -> referring to seniors' (wxk, ljs, llsw etc.) blogs

- Above is the Forsaken's behaviour model analysis on WAN exam environment

- On LAN exam enviornment?

- idk

- But it doesn't matter

- He Forsaken anyways
